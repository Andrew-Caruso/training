# Fitting and parameter estimation
Welcome to the exercises of the **Fitting and parameter estimation** learning module!

## Your First fit with ROOT
The macro **firstFit.C** is only half-way complete. In the code a fit of a histogram is performed
and the parameters of the fitted model are inspected.
Try to complete the code putting to a good use what you learned during the lectures.
The solution is available in the [firstFit_Solution.C](firstFit_Solution.C) macro.

## Correlation of Parameters
The **correlatedParameters.C** is a simple macro which fits an exponential to a histogram. It seems that there is a problem. While the fit parameters look ok, the correlation matrix shows something fishy. Can you say what is going wrong and why?

## Likelihood and Chi-Square estimators
Run the macro **fitPanel.C** with this command
```
root -l fitPanel.C
```
This leaves open a window with a histogram drawn. The entries are distributed according to a Gauss but the bins are narrow and the number of entries low. Right click on the histogram line (or with two fingers if you have a mac). Select *FitPanel* to open a fit panel. Now fit the histogram selecting the Chi-Square and Likelihood estimators.
What changes to the parameter values? And to their uncertainties?

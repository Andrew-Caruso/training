# Histograms, Graphs and Functions Exercises

Welcome to the exercises of the **Histograms, Graphs and Functions** learning module!

## A macro to build a histogram
Create a macro which builds and draws a histogram with the following features:
- The number of bins is 64 and the x axis ranges from 0 to 16.
- It is filled with random numbers distributed according to a linear function (*pol1*).
- Its line width is thicker than the default one.

You can find a solution [here](SimpleHistogram.C).

## A macro to build a graph
Create a macro which builds and draws a graph with the following features:
- The title of the plot is *My graph*.
- The x and y axis have labels `my_{X}` and `my_{Y}` respectively.
- It has three points with the following coordinates (1,0), (2,3), (3,4).
- The marker is a full square. Its coulour is red.
- An orange line joins the points.

You can find a solution [here](SimpleGraph.C).

## A macro to build a function
Create a macro that follows these steps:
- Create a function with formula *cos(x)* and draw it.
- Create another *cos(x)*, but scale the argument of the cosine by adding a parameter.
- Set a value for the parameter.
- Change the line color of the second function.
- Draw the second function in the same canvas as the first one.

You can find a solution [here](SimpleFunction.C).
